    This tomato soup is inspired by one of the most famous recipes out there — Marcella Hazan’s Tomato Sauce.

    Butter, tomatoes, and onion are simmered until slightly thickened. Out comes the onion and the sauce is ready to be spooned over pasta.
    
    It’s genius and absolutely delicious. We use the same three ingredients in this tomato soup, but add a little water and blend everything together just before serving.

<ul div class="ingredients">
    <li>4 tbsp olive oil</li>
    <li>4 celery sticks, finely chopped</li>

<ol div class="instructions">
    <li>Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.</li>
    <li>For the ragu, heat the olive oil in a frying pan over a low heat and fry the celery, carrots and onion for approximately 15 minutes, until softened and golden. Add the garlic and rosemary and fry for two more minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the beef and pork mince and cook until the liquid from the meat has been absorbed.</li>
